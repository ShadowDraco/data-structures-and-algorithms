# Challenge Sort Comparators

Write a hash table implementation for future reference!

## Approach & Efficiency

The hash table has many ways to implement hashing to increase efficiency and lookup while reducing collisions. The hashing function is currently built very simply and our collisions are only handled with a linked list or overwriting.
Other functions include `has(key)` `get(key)` `hash(value)` `set(key, value)` and `keys()` All values placed into this table should be strings.
## Solution

<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

To run the code simply call one of the lookup or set functions on a hashtable instance in the file, Tests will also be available with `npm test hash-table`
